The starting dataset for this analysis is *data/cah.json*. The *data/CAH_predicted_answers.txt* is a generated dataset for the NLG portion. *data/model_nlg_1.pt* and *data/model_nlg_2.pt* are the final trained model from the NLG portion. Due to the long training time, these models are saved to be run easily without having to re-run. The results are presented and summarized in *results/CAH Deck.pptx*



<u>**Project Goals:**</u>

**Joke Generator** - Given a randomly chosen question pick funny answers

**Topic Modeling & Clustering** - Find CAHâ€™s favorite subjects and words on the Answer Cards

**Generate new Answer Cards (Natural Language Generation NLG)** - Because the old cards are now tired if you play the game enough times
